# hello-world

Hello:

I am learning to understand and use GitHub to continue and expand my learning into programming and scripting. In particular, I would like to leard Python so I can program/script applications that I can implement at my workplace. Powershell is another scripting language I would like to be more proficient at. Anything i can learn or borrow in GitHub is trully appreciated.

Thank you!
